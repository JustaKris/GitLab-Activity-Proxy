# GitLab Activity Mirror

This repository exists to reflect my ongoing contributions to private/internal GitLab-hosted projects.

To respect company confidentiality and security, no source code or proprietary content is included here.

## Purpose

Since most of my day-to-day work happens in private GitLab repositories, this repo is used to mirror commit activity and demonstrate consistent engagement with collaborative software development workflows.

You can find my public projects [here](https://github.com/justakris?tab=repositories).

## How It Works

A GitLab CI/CD job pushes generic commit logs to this repo whenever I contribute to internal projects. This keeps my GitHub profile up-to-date and provides visibility into my developer activity, without exposing sensitive information.
